# jssynth
#### A javascript synth inspired by classic analogue synthesisers like the minimoog

jssynth is an analogue-style synth that uses the Web Audio API to create sound in the browser. jssynth is polyphonic and supports up to three oscillators per voice for a fuller sound

*jsynth is currently under development and is not feature complete.*
Some features are yet to be implemented and some (like oscillator/filter locking) still need to be fixed. Future improvements may include sound FX generators for each of the oscillators, improvements to the filter stage (particularly for the bandpass) and an FM synthesis stage to model instruments like strings, woodwind, brass etc.
